## Things it would do

-   Ask user whether `react` is to be included or not.
-   Create `browserslist` in `package.json` to target browsers.
-   Ask for creating `wpw.config.js` with default stuff.
-   Ask for creating `wpw.env.js` with default environment and add defaults to `package.json` to run `@wpackio/cli init` after `yarn install` to create a default `env`.
