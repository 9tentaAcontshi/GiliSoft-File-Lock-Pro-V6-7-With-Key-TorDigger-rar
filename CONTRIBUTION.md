## Create a package

We use [plopjs](https://github.com/amwmedia/plop) to automate boilerplate package generation.

Use it to create a new package.

**`yarn plop`**

Now go through the questions and a new package will be created for you.

## Test

**`yarn test`**

Run all tests through jest.

## Publish

**`yarn lerna publish**

This will bump version and publish. Make sure you have access to `@wpw` npm org
or ask a maintainer.
