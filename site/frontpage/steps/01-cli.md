```bash
npx @wpackio/cli
```

This command will install `@wpackio/scripts` to your project's
`devDependencies`. It will also create a `package.json` if necessary and will
add a `bootstrap` script to your `package.json`.

It provides an on-boarding experience where you don't need to worry about adding
scripts and dependencies.
