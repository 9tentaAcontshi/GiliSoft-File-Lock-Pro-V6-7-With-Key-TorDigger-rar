title: What can I do with <span class="wpackio-logo-text">wpack.<em>io</em></span>?
---

Do you always wanted to get into modern front-end development
but was too worried with all the tooling involved? Well, I was too, and after
spending over a year learning everything, I thought it is time WordPress has
an awesome DX for front-end development too.

<span class="wpackio-logo-text">wpack.<em>io</em></span> is an attempt to overcome all
the pain points from setting up proper tooling to make webpack work with WordPress.

-   ðŸ‘‰ Have Create React App like _Best In Class_ developer experience for WordPress Plugin/Theme development.
-   ðŸ‘‰ Consume all the modern packages from [npm registry](https://npmjs.com).
-   ðŸ‘‰ Write javascript with modern ES2018 (ES6+) syntax and compile it down to ES5 (or in accordance to your `.browserslistrc`).
-   ðŸ‘‰ Automatically minify and bundle code with [webpack](https://webpack.js.org).
-   ðŸ‘‰ Split large files automatically and have PHP library to `wp_enqueue_script` all generated parts.
-   ðŸ‘‰ Use SASS/SCSS language to create stylesheets.
-   ðŸ‘‰ Use postcss autoprefixer to automatically make your CSS work with needed vendor prefixes.
-   ðŸ‘‰ Implement all the above to your existing wamp, mamp, vvv (basically any) dev server.
-   ðŸ‘‰ Create production grade, super optimized and minified files with one command (hello CI).
-   ðŸ‘‰ [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Flowtype](https://flow.org/) to take your js carrier to the next level. This tooling itself is written in typescript.
-   ðŸ‘‰ All the stuff you need to start developing using [react](https://reactjs.org/). Hello Gutenberg!
-   ðŸ‘‰ _HOT MODULE REPLACEMENT(**HMR**)_ for CSS/SASS and supported javascript modules.
-   ðŸ‘‰ Create directly installable `.zip` file.
