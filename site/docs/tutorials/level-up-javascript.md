title: Level up your JavaScript (Front-End) Skills
order: 3
---

I created this tool in the hope that it will bring more WordPress developers to
this crazy moving front-end world (crazy in all good way). With the tooling
out of the way, you can actually focus on what matters, writing code.

Here's a list of tutorials and websites (some free and some paid, but I don't get paid if
you subscribe ðŸ˜œ) I have found extremely useful.

1. You don't know JS (I am not saying to **you**, it's the name of the book) - https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS
1. Courses by Wesbos - https://wesbos.com/courses/
1. Courses by Dylan C. Israel - https://scrimba.com/@PizzaPokerGuy
1. Courses by Kent C. Dodds - https://egghead.io/instructors/kentcdodds
1. Journal by my friend Saikat - https://github.com/saikatdas0790/tech-learning-journal/blob/master/2018/2018.md Might help you get started ðŸ˜ƒ.

So thank you for reading and all the best with your journey of becoming a great
front-end (full stack, given we already know WordPress & PHP ðŸ˜‰) developer.
