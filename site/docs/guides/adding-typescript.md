title: Adding Typescript to your project
order: 3
---

`@wpackio/scripts` has first-class support for both [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
and [flow type](https://flow.org/). While flow works right out of the box
there are some configuration needed for typescript.

## Provided tooling

`@wpackio/scripts` comes with the build tooling for typescript, not typescript
itself. Also note that, we use [babel 7](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-typescript)
to compile typescript and [Fork TS Checked Webpack Plugin](https://github.com/Realytics/fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin)
to show type-errors during build/development time. So there are some gotchas.

## What doesn't work

As [explained in microsoft blog](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/typescript/2018/08/27/typescript-and-babel-7/)
the following doesn't work when using babel to compile typescript.

-   namespaces.
-   bracket style type-assertion/cast syntax regardless of when JSX is enabled (i.e. writing `<Foo>x` wonâ€™t work even in `.ts` files if JSX support is turned on, but you can instead write `x as Foo`).
-   enums that span multiple declarations (i.e. enum merging).
-   legacy-style import/export syntax (i.e. `import foo = require(...)` and `export = foo`).

So keep these in mind.

## Installing dependencies

First we need to install `typescript` itself.

```bash
npm i -D typescript
```

Now create `tsconfig.json` at the root according to your need. Here's a sample.

```json
{
	"compilerOptions": {
		/* Basic Options */
		"target": "esnext", // we would be compiling with babel, so we can target esnext
		"module": "esnext", // for import() and es5 import/export
		"lib": ["esnext", "dom"], // include all libraries you need
		"jsx": "preserve", // because babel will transform it

		/* Strict Type-Checking Options */
		"strict": true, // suggested

		/* Module Resolution Options */
		"moduleResolution": "node", // because of webpack
		"allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true, // to make it compatible with babel
		"esModuleInterop": true, // to make it compatible with babel
		"isolatedModules": true // to limit implementation
	}
}
```

Having `moduleResolution` and `isolatedModules` is a good idea, cause you won't
accidentally use something that isn't supported.

## Usage

Now simply define `.ts` or `.tsx` file in your `wpackio.project.js` file as
entry-point.

```js
module.exports = {
	// ...
	files: {
		name: 'tsapp',
		entry: {
			main: ['./src/tsapp/main.ts'],
		},
	},
};
```

Now you are good to go. The compiler will also show any `ts` error you might have.
